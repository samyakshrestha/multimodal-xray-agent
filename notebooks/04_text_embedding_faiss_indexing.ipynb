It builds the **PubMed abstract index** that powers evidence-grounded citation retrieval via FAISS and SPECTER2. This module enables the agent to return relevant biomedical literature when answering user queries or interpreting X-ray captions.\n","\n","---\n","## Background\n","\n","In order to support high-quality evidence generation, our multimodal radiology assistant includes a **text-retrieval module** that can return semantically relevant biomedical literature in response to user queries or image-derived captions. This module enhances factual grounding, citation transparency, and interpretability — all critical for clinical-facing AI systems.\n","\n","We use the **`MedRAG/pubmed`** dataset hosted on Hugging Face, a cleaned subset of the PubMed Open Access collection. It contains over 2.2 million biomedical papers, each with:\n","\n","- A stable `PMID` identifier\n","- A structured `title`\n","- An abstract stored in the `content` field\n","\n","These papers span a wide range of clinical and research topics, making them ideal for embedding-based semantic search.\n","\n","In this notebook, we sample a 30,000-record subset and build a **FAISS-based text retrieval index** using **SPECTER2**, a state-of-the-art transformer model trained to embed scientific documents. This index enables fast, scalable retrieval of relevant PubMed papers based on either a user query or an automatically generated caption from a medical image.\n","\n","This forms the **text tower** of our dual-retrieval system and powers the citation-generating component of our multi-agent architecture.\n","\n","---\n","## Workflow Overview\n","\n","### **Step 1 – Environment Setup**\n","- Verified GPU availability (T4 or A100) and activated device-aware logic.\n","- Installed required libraries:\n","  - `sentence-transformers` for SPECTER2 embedding\n","  - `datasets` for Hugging Face dataset loading\n","  - `faiss-cpu` for building a fast similarity index\n","\n","### **Step 2 – Sample and Export PubMed Subset**\n","- Loaded the `MedRAG/pubmed` dataset from Hugging Face (2.2M entries).\n","- Sampled the first **30,000 records** for prototype-scale text retrieval.\n","- Exported two files to `data/pubmed/`:\n","  - `raw_abstracts.jsonl` – Full records with `pmid`, `title`, `abstract`\n","  - `text_metadata.json` – Lightweight manifest for runtime lookup\n","\n","### **Step 3 – Embed with SPECTER2**\n","- Loaded the `allenai/specter2_base` model (768-D output).\n","- Concatenated `title + abstract` → embedded in batches of 64 with normalization.\n","- Saved full embedding matrix as:\n","  - `text_vectors.npy` (float32, 30k × 768)\n","\n","### **Step 4 – Build and Save FAISS Index**\n","- Created a cosine similarity FAISS index using `faiss.IndexFlatIP(dim=768)`.\n","- Added all SPECTER2 embeddings to the index.\n","- Persisted the index to disk as:\n","  - `text_faiss.bin` (≈88 MB)\n","  - Ensures O(1) semantic lookup during inference\n","\n","### **Step 5 – Sanity Check: Query the Index**\n","- Queried the index with two test prompts:\n","  - `\"chest x-ray findings in pulmonary embolism\"`\n","  - `\"case reports involving lung nodules in pediatric patients\"`\n","- Verified that returned titles were semantically aligned and non-random.\n","- Confirmed full end-to-end retrieval stack is functional and reproducible.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Final Output Directory**\n","All artifacts are saved to the following directory for downstream use in the RAG pipeline:\n","\n","```\n","data/pubmed/\n","├── raw_abstracts.jsonl       # Full 30k sample\n","├── text_metadata.json        # Lightweight manifest\n","├── text_vectors.npy          # 768-D SPECTER2 embeddings\n","└── text_faiss.bin            # FAISS cosine index (768-D)\n","```\n","\n","This module completes the text-retrieval half of our citation-augmented agent.
