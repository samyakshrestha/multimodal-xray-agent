It generates a curated set of ~1,500 question-answer pairs based on the **IU-Xray \"impression\" field**, covering both template-based and GPT-4o-enhanced paraphrases. This dataset is optimized for use in LoRA fine-tuning of a BioGPT QA model.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Background\n","\n","In order to teach our model how to interpret and respond to clinical radiology summaries, we curate a structured instruction-tuning dataset using the impression field from the IU-Xray corpus. These radiology impressions resemble real-world CXR reports and serve as a natural foundation for medical Q/A generation.\n","\n","The goal of this notebook is to generate three high-quality QA pairs per impression:\n","\n","1. **Q1 (Template):** \"What is the radiologic impression?\"\n","2. **Q2 (Template):** \"Summarize the key thoracic findings.\"\n","3. **Q3 (GPT-4o):** A paraphrased question from a small template pool, with a paraphrased answer generated by GPT-4o.\n","\n","This combination provides both linguistic diversity and task consistency, enhancing the quality and variety of the fine-tuning dataset.\n","\n","To ensure precision:\n","- **Normal/abnormal filtering** was used to bias toward informative cases.\n","- **GPT-4o** was instructed to keep responses under 25 tokens.\n","- **Temperature** was set to `0.3` for reproducibility and minimal hallucination.\n","- **Hallucination risk** was mitigated through careful prompt design and filtering rules.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Workflow Overview\n","\n","### **Step 1 – Impression Filtering**\n","- Loaded `iu_impr.jsonl` containing raw impressions.\n","- Applied regex-based heuristics to segment into:\n","  - `Tier A` – clearly abnormal, clean impressions\n","  - `Tier B` – mildly corrupted with redactions (e.g., \"XXXX\")\n","  - `Tier C` – likely normal cases\n","- Removed overly short or severely corrupted entries.\n","- Combined Tiers A and B and saved 520 selected impressions for QA generation.\n","\n","### **Step 2 – Sampling**\n","- Randomly sampled 500+ impressions for generation, ensuring sufficient linguistic diversity.\n","- Saved result to `iu_sampled_for_qa.jsonl` for reproducibility.\n","\n","### **Step 3 – QA Generation**\n","- For each impression, generated 3 QA pairs:\n","  - Q1 and Q2 using fixed templates\n","  - Q3 using GPT-4o paraphrasing (with hallucination-aware prompt)\n","- Temperature fixed at 0.3 for deterministic output.\n","- GPT-4o instructed to rephrase impression within 25 tokens, preserving all findings.\n","- Saved final dataset as `qa_pairs_lora.jsonl`.\n","\n","### **Step 4 – Train/Val Split**\n","- Split final QA dataset 90%/10% into `train.jsonl` and `val.jsonl`\n","- Each record contains: `uuid`, `question`, and `answer`\n","- Enables reproducible training and evaluation during LoRA fine-tuning.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Final Output Directory**\n","All generated assets are saved to the following directory for downstream use:\n","\n","```\n","data/iu_xray/\n","├── iu_impr.jsonl              #
